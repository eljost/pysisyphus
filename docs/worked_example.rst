Worked example
==============

This page provides a general overview of pysisyphus's capabilities for optimizing ground
state reaction paths for the example of a tris-pericyclic reaction between a tropone derivative and
dimethylfulvene.

You can find a short discussion of the reaction on Steven M. Bacharachs
`blog`_. Here we focus on how to obtain TS1. Instead of using DFT as in the original
`publication`_ we'll employ the semi-emperical tight binding code `xtb`_. It allows us
to run all necessary calculations on common desktop hardware in little time (2 min, using 6
physical CPU cores).

    Educts, TS and products of the tris-pericyclic reaction between a tropone derivative and
    dimethylfulvene.

At first, we have to create appropriate educt and product geometries using the molecular
editor of our choice, e.g., `avogadro`_ or `TmoleX`_. Given a reasonable educt geometry a
suitable product geometry can be constructed by decreasing the distance between the
two ring systems and optimizing the result, e.g., by `xtb`_. Sometimes it may be easier
to start with the product geometry, and obtain the educt from it. **Consistent
atom ordering in both geometries is mandatory!** Usually it's a bad idea to construct both
geometries independently, as it is easy to mess up the atom ordering.

.. _`avogadro`: https://avogadro.cc/
.. _`TmoleX`: https://www.3ds.com/products-services/biovia/products/molecular-modeling-simulation/solvation-chemistry/turbomoler/

Given educts (`min_xtbopt.xyz`) and product (`prod_xtbopt.xyz`) we can create the YAML input.
Our goal is to obtain the barrier heights for the reaction shown in :numref:`reaction_fig` by
means of growing string (GS) calculation, transition state (TS) optimization, intrinsic
reaction coordinate (IRC) calculation and subsequent optimization of the IRC endpoints.
The full input is shown below. We'll go over it step by step.

.. code-block:: yaml

    geom:
     type: dlc
     fn: [min_xtbopt.xyz, prod_xtbopt.xyz]
    preopt:
    cos:
     type: gs
     max_nodes: 18
     climb: True
    opt:
     type: string
     align: False
     max_cycles: 20
    tsopt:
     type: rsirfo
     do_hess: True
     thresh: gau
     hessian_recalc: 3
    irc:
     type: eulerpc
     rms_grad_thresh: 0.0005
    endopt:
    calc:
     type: xtb
     pal: 6

The desired coordinate system and the file names of the input geometries are given in the
:code:`geom` block.

.. code-block:: yaml

    geom:
     type: dlc
     fn: [min_xtbopt.xyz, prod_xtbopt.xyz]

Here we chose delocalized internal coordiantes (DLC) for our GS, which is the
preferred way. Alternatively Cartesian coordinates could be used by
:code:`type: cart`. If DLCs fail, Cartesian coordinates should be tried.

.. code-block:: yaml

    preopt:

The :code:`preopt` block is given without any additional keywords, so sane defaults will
be used for preoptimizing educt and product geometries (Rational function
optimization (RFO) in redundant internal coordinates). Strictly, in our case preoptimization
is not necessary, as we already preoptimized the geometries using `xtb`_. But in general
if is advised to span chain of states (COS) like GS or nudged elastic band (NEB) between
stationary points on the potential energy surface.
If the educts and products are NOT covalently bound it may be a good idea to restrict the
number of preoptimization cycles to a small number (:code:`max_cycles: 10`), as these
optimizations are sometimes hard to converge. Please see :ref:`Optimization of Minima`
for a list of possible keywords in the :code:`preopt` block.

.. code-block:: yaml

    cos:
     type: gs
     max_nodes: 18
     climb: True

The :code:`cos` block configures COS calculations. Here we request a GS (:code:`gs`)
with 18 nodes (images) between educt and product, resulting in a total string length
of 20 nodes. By default first and last  node (educt and product) are kept fixed
throughout the optimization. We enable a climbing image (CI) to obtain a better TS guess.
Please see :ref:`Chain Of States Methods` for further information on COS methods.

.. code-block:: yaml

    opt:
     type: string
     align: False
     max_cycles: 20

COS/GS optimization is controlled via the :code:`opt` block. For GS optimization one should always
use :code:`type: string`. In internal coordinates we disable automated geometry alignment,
as it is not needed. We also restrict the number of optimization cycles to 20 (default 50).
The chosen optimizer will do steepest descent (SD) steps when the string grew in the previous
cycle, otherwise conjugate gradient (CG) steps are used. When the GS is fully grown/connected
the optimizer will use limited-memory Broyden-FletcherGoldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) to determine
more sophisticated steps.

.. code-block:: yaml

    tsopt:
     type: rsirfo
     do_hess: True
     thresh: gau
     hessian_recalc: 3

After GS convergence the highest energy image (HEI) is determined by cubic splining
and used as guess for a classical TS optimization using restricted step image RFO (RSIRFO).
:code:`do_hess: True` requests a frequency calculation after the TS optimization.
The Hessian is recalculated every 3th step. When the Hessian for the chosen computational
method is reasonably cheap it is a good idea to recalculate it periodically.
Between recalculations it's updated using the Bofill-update. Convergence critera are
tightened from the default :code:`thresh: gau_loose` to :code:`thresh: gau`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    irc:
     type: eulerpc
     rms_grad_thresh: 0.0005

IRC integration is controlled in the :code:`irc` block. By default the Euler-predictor-corrector
(EulerPC) integrator is used. Integration is terminated when the root-mean-square (RMS) of the
gradient is equal to or less than 0.0005 au. Possible inputs are given in
:ref:`Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC)`.


.. code-block:: yaml

    endopt:

Similar to :code:`preopt` the :code:`endopt` will be executed with default arguments. It
is used to optimize the IRC endpoints to stationary points and enables printing of
additional information like RMS deviation of atomic positions (RMSD) between optimized
endpoints and initial geometries. The RMSD values help in deciding if the obtained TS
actually connects presumed educts and products.

.. code-block:: yaml

    calc:
     type: xtb
     pal: 6

The :code:`calc` block configures the level of theory used in energy/gradient/Hessian
calculations. Here we chose `xtb`_ and requested 6 CPU cores. Additional inputs for
xtb can be found in the :ref:`xtb module documentation <pysisyphus.calculators.XTB module>`

With everything set up we are ready to actually execute pysisyphus! Assuming the above
YAML is saved to `01_pericyclic.yaml` just run

.. code-block:: bash

    pysis 01_pericyclic.yaml | tee pysis.log

By default pysisyphus prints to STDOUT so you have to capture STDOUT explicitely. We use
:code:`tee` so everything is logged to a file and printed simulatenously.
A lot of files and output will be produced so we will go over everything slowly.

The whole run starts with preoptimizations of educt and product. Both optimizations converge
quickly, as the geometries are already preoptimized.

After an optimization remaining RMS and max of the forces are reported for internal and
Cartesian coordinates. If the internal force is zero, but a substantial Cartesian
force remains someting went wrong, e.g., the generated coordinate system is lacking
important coordinates. In such cases the generated coordinates can be examined manually
:code:`pysistrj [geom file] --internals` to determine important missing coordinates.

Preoptimizations are followed by the GS optimization.

The string grows quickly and is fully grown in cycle 8. String size and barrier height
between the first and HEI are reported in every cycle.
From cycle 8 on, a CI is employed. The final HEI index is printed at the end. As we
interpolate the HEI, the index may be a fractional number. The COS optimization is followed
by a TS optimization.

The initial HEI TS guess features only two sizable imaginary frequencies, confirming that
it is a suitable TS guess. Root 0 has the highest overlap (85%) with the HEI tangent and is
chosen for maximization in the TS optimization, whereas the energy will be minimized along
the remaining modes. The optimization converged quickly in 10 cycles. A final Hessian is
computed at the optimized TS as we used :code:`do_hess: True`. Only one imaginary frequency
remains, which is the desired result for a first-order saddle point. All sizable imaginary
modes are written to `.trj` files and can be viewed by tools like jmol.

Barrier heights between the TS and first and last COS image (no thermochemistry is included!)
are reported. In this case the energy difference between the first COS image and the TS is
very small, indicating an early TS, similar to the educts. This is also be confirmed by
examining :numref:`reaction_fig`.

The imaginary mode is used to displace the TS towards educts and product.
As the TS is very similar to the educt, forward IRC integration already terminates after
one cycle.  Maybe, further integration steps could be forced by tightening the threshold
in the :code:`irc:` block. Backward integration terminates after 22 cycles. At first,
the gradient increases and after the inflection point is passed, falls off again as
a stationary point is approached. In the end both IRC endpoints are fully optimized to
stationary points.
