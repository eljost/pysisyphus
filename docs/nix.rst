Installation via Nix
********************

An easy and reliable way to get a complete pysisyphus installation, including additional quantum chemistry (QC) codes, is possible through the `Nix package manager`_. Required Nix files for the QC codes and their dependencies (linear algebra & MPI libraries etc.) are provided by the NixWithChemistry_ overlay.

Nix installations are fully reproducible and extremly simple to accomplish for any potential pysisyphus user, as most of the necessary configuration is already described in the respective Nix files.

The `Nix Pills`_ series provides an informative introduction to the general concepts behind Nix.

Prerequisites
=============

Please follow the installation instructions in the `nix manual`_ and additional hints from NixWithChemistry_ to set up a working Nix installation on your system. You'll probably have to allow unfree packages.

.. code-block:: bash
    nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-20.09 nixos
    nix-channel --update
    export NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1

Configuration
=============

Only minor configuration is required for a successful pysisyphus installation with Nix: Clone the pysisyphus repository from github, initialize the NixWithChemistry_ submodule and adapt `nix/nixwithchemistry/config.nix` as necessary.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/eljost/pysisyphus.git $install_dir
    cd $install_dir
    git submodule init nix/nixwithchemistry
    git submodule update
    # Adapt the configuration file with the $EDITOR of your choice (nano/vim/kate/gedit...)
    $EDITOR nix/nixwithchemistry/config.nix

Please adapt the following lines in :code:`config.nix`:
    - :code:`gaussian`, :code:`mrcc`, :code:`orca` and :code:`turbomole` should be set to :code:`false` if no license and source/binary archive is available
    - Adapat the available CPU extensions on your machine (you can list them with :code:`grep "flags" /proc/cpuinfo`)
    - If you are not using CUDA enabled hardware, set :code:`cuda = false;`.
    - :code:`network` should be adapted if you intend to run pysisyphus on a HPC cluster. Possible values are: :code:`network = "ethernet"`, :code:`network = "omnipath"` or :code:`network = "infiniband"`. If you are running pysisyphus on local machine keep :code:`network = "ethernet"`.
    - :code:`mpi` is set to :code:`"mvapich2"` by default. There  is usually no reason to change this but you could also use :code:`"openmpi"`. This does **not** mean that the selected MPI version will be used in all programs. MRCC requires IntelMPI and GAMESS-US OpenMPI, no matter what you select here
    - :code:`blas = mkl` should be updated to :code:`blas = "openblas"` if you don't have an Intel CPU.


Installation
============

After you updated :code:`nix/nixwithchemistry/config.nix`, you can start building the actual QC codes
and all dependencies.

The initial `nix-build` took about 3.5 h on my laptop, equipped with a i7-8750H (6 physical cores), 16 GB RAM and a NVMe SSD and requires about 15 GB disk space in the local Nix store (only ORCA was enabled, Gaussian and Turbomole were disabled).

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $install_dir/nix
    # Executing nix-build for the first time may take a while as your local Nix store
    # will be populated.
    # Please grab a coffee while the command runs or start your own coffee plantation
    # and return after you picked your first crop of coffee berries â˜•.
    nix-build

You will likely depend on closed source software (ORCA, Turbomole, Gaussian, ...) , which is not freely redistributable. If the binary/source archives of these programs are missing from the Nix-store, the installation process will interrupt and tell you how to provide the required files. So it's a good idea to investigate the output of `nix-build` from time to time check, if manual intervention is required.

Running pysisyphus with Nix
===========================

You can now make pysisyphus available to your user environment by

.. code-block:: bash

    nix-env -f default.nix -i

or launch a `nix-shell`_ with pysisyphus by

.. code-block:: bash

   nix-shell --pure

or use :code:`nix run`

.. code-block:: bash

    nix run

**WARNING** In case of :code:`nix run` the resulting shell will not be pure. Depending on your system configuration conda/pip/... packages and configurations from the system might leak in. You are definitely safe with :code:`nix-shell --pure`.

Do not be confused if the commands of the underlying quantum chemistry codes are not available. They are made available to directly to the pysisyphus entry point, but not necessarily to your shell.
