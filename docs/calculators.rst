Calculators
***********

Exploring potential energy surfaces (PESs) requires calculation of energies
and its derivatives (gradients, Hessian matrices).

For testing purposes and method development, pysisyphus implements various analytical
2d potentials, as they allow fast evaluations of the aforementioned quantities.
Actual (production) calculations are carried out by wrapping existing quantum chemistry
codes (ORCA, TURBOMOLE, Gaussian etc.) and delegating the required calculations to them.
Pysisyphus generates all necessary inputs, executes the QC code and parses their output
for the requested quantities.

Furthermore pysisyphus provides several "meta"-calculators which wrap other (actual) calculators,
to modify calculated energies and forces. Examples for this are the `Dimer`_ calculator,
used for carrying out transition state searches or the `ONIOM`_ calculator,
allowing  multi-level calculations comprising different levels of theory.

External forces, e.g. a restraining spherical potential or harmonic restraints on
primitive internal coordinates (stretches, bends, torsion) can be applied with
`ExternalPotential`_.

YAML input
==========

Possible keywords for the YAML input can be derived from inspecting the possible arguments
of the `Calculator` base-class (see below) and the possible arguments of the respective calculator,
e.g. ORCA or XTB.

The most commonly used keywords, derived from the `Calculator` baseclass are `mem`,
handling the requested memory per core in MB, `pal`, handling the number of requested CPU cores,
`charge`, the total charge of the system and `mult`, the systems multiplicity.

For (excited state, ES) calculations carried out with calculators derived from `OverlapCalculator`
additional keywords are possible. The most common keywords controlling ES calculations are `track`, activating
ES tracking, `ovlp_type`, selecting the tracking algorithm and `ovlp_with`, handling the selection of the
reference cycle.

An example input highlighting the most important keywords is shown below.

OpenMolcas
----------
Pysisyphus currently supports energy and gradient calculations utilizing the
`&rasscf` and/or the `&mcpdft` sections. Neither analytical nor numerical Hessians are
yet implemented for the OpenMolcas-calculator.

Two keywords are always required: `inporb` and `basis`, with the former pointing
to a `.RasOrb` file and the latter containing the selected atomic orbital basis, e.g.,
`ano-rcc-vdzp`.
Additional input for the `&gateway`, `&rasscf` and `&mcpdft` sections can be given
via the respective keyword(s).

Due to restrictions of the current design, simple keywords
that don't take further arguments as `cmsi` in `&rasscf` or `grad` and `mspdft` in
`&mcpdft` still must be given with a trailing colon. See below for an example.

Turbomole 7.x
-------------
Pysisyphus does not implement a wrapper for `define`, so the user has to
manually prepare a directory containing a valid control file.
An automated `define` wrapper, restricted to ground state functionality, is
available via the `QCEngine project <https://github.com/MolSSI/QCEngine>`_,
to which I contributed the Turbomole harness.

Care should be taken to include only the minimum amount of necessary files in the
`control_path` directory, e.g., `(auxbasis, basis, control, coord, mos)` for a
closed-shell calculation using RI. **A gradient file must not be present
in control_path, as well as other subdirectories and files with .out extension.**
The `coord` file, while not strictly required, should be kept too, to facilitate
testing of the setup with standalone Turbomole.

It may be a good idea to pre-converge the calculation in `control_path`,
to see if the setup is correct and actually works. Resulting files like
`energy`, `statistics` can be deleted; `mos` should be kept, as the converged
MOs are reused in pysisyphus.

If an excited-state optimization is desired, care has to be taken, to include
**$exopt [n]** for TD-DFT/TDA or the **geoopt state=([n])** (ricc2)! Tracking
of excited states is currently possible for closed shell `egrad` and `ricc2` calculations.

The current implementation was tested against Turbomole 7.4.1 and QCEngine 0.19.0.
Please see `examples/complex/11_turbomole_gs_tsopt <https://github.com/eljost/pysisyphus/tree/master/examples/complex/11_turbomole_gs_tsopt>`_ for a full example where Turbmole is
utilized in a growing string calculation. The same example, using QCEngine, is found
in `examples/complex/12_qcengine_turbomole_gs_tsopt <https://github.com/eljost/pysisyphus/tree/master/examples/complex/12_qcengine_turbomole_gs_tsopt>`_. MOs are not reused with the
QCEngine calculator, so the native pysisyphus calculator is probably faster.

DFT-D3

Method to add DFT-D3 dispersion corrections as an external potential
via the program developed by the Grimme group <https://www.chemie.uni-bonn.de/grimme/de/software/dft-d3/get_dft-d3>.

This is for use with calculators that do not natively provide D3 corrections (e.g. OpenMolcas).
Usage mirrors that of other external potentials, with an example given below.

.. code:: yaml
    
    # General input structure for restraints
    calc:
     type: ext
     # Multiple potentials could be specified here as a list
     potentials:
       # Add atom-pairwise D3 dispersion correction as a differentiable, external potential
       - type: d3
         # Functional is specified in TURBOMOLE format, all lower case.
         functional: pbe
         # Optional Becke-Johnson damping, default false, recommended true
