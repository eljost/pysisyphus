    For -1 <= x <= 1 a must be 1.0; for 0 <= x <= 1 a must be 0.0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        Array of values in the interval [-1.0, 1.0].
    a
        Parameter a; see eq. (20) in [1]. Depends on the integration limits.
    alpha
        Parameter alpha with optimal value of 0.6 (see eq. (21) in [1]) in
        combination with Chebyshev 2nd kind roots and weights. As alpha is
        increased grid points are shifted towards r = 0 and r = oo.
    atomic_radius
        Additional parameter to better tailor the distribution of radial
        points.

        1d-array of r-values mapped from [-1, 1] to [0, oo].

        1d-array of derivatives dr/dx that are required for the change of
        variables in the integration.

    Adapated from the 'radial_grid(alpha)' subroutine found in'atomic_grids.f90'
    of Stone's GDMA code. Acutally a grid with one point less is returned to
    avoid division by 0.0.

    NOTE: In contrast to chebyshev_2nd_kind() above, the weights in the equation
    below already seem to include a factor of r**2. We remove it, so the function
    behaves similar to the other radial integration approaches.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n
        Positive integer > 1; number of points + 1.
    m_r
        Exponent, m_r = 2 was found to be sufficient. See Section 5.1 of [2]
