    Reformulation fo the algorithm. This is implemented e.g., in YAFF.
    https://github.com/molmod/yaff/blob/master/yaff/sampling/nvt.py

csvr_closure() is based on the implementation provided on Bussis homepage:
    https://sites.google.com/site/giovannibussi/downloads/resamplekin.tgz
    (At least in my implementation) there seems to be a problem with
    the conserved quantity, which is not conserved at all ...
csvr_closure_2() is based on [2]
