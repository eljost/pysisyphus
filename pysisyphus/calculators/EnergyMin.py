        Use energy and derivatives of the calculator with lower energy.

        This calculators carries out two calculations with different settings
        and returns the results of the lower energy one. This can be used
        to consider flips between a singlet and a triplet PES etc.

        Parameters
        ----------
        calculator1
            Wrapped QC calculator that provides energies and its derivatives.
        calculator2
            Wrapped QC calculator that provides energies and its derivatives.
        mix
            Enable mixing of both forces, according to the approach outlined
            in [2]. Can be used to optimize guesses for MECPs.
        alpha
            Smoothing parameter in Hartree. See [2] for a discussion.
        sigma
            Unitless gap size parameter. The final gap becomes
            smaller for bigga sigmas. Has to be adapted for each case. See
            [2] for a discussion (p. 407 right column and p. 408 left column.)
        min_energy_diff
            Energy difference in Hartree.
            When set to a value != 0 and the energy difference between both
            calculators drops below this value, execution of both calculations
            is diabled for 'check_after' cycles. In these cycles the calculator
            choice remains fixed, that is only one state is calculated. After
            'check_after' cycles, both energies will be calculated again and it
            is checked, if the previous calculator choice is still valid.
            In conjunction with 'check_after' both arguments can be used to
            save computational ressources and to speed up the calculations.
        check_after
            Amount of cycles in which the calculator choice remains fixed.
